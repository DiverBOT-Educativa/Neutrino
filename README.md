# Magnetic field anomaly detection
## An European Astro Pi Challenge Proyect
## by Neutrino's Team

####What is our experiment idea?
Earth magnetic field not only protects life and electronics here on Earth, but also protects low orbit satellites and space station astronauts, like the ones that work on the ISS.
The main reason of our experiment is to measure the magnetic field of Earth and detect all the possible anomalies.


####How will we use the Astro Pi computers to perform our experiment?
To perform our experiment we will mainly use the magnetic field sensor as well as the positional data of the ISS. The data read will be compare in real time with the data expected using several equations that describe the dipole magnetic field, and always taking into account the ISS position.
Data will be represented on the LED array to show real-time information about anomalies detected, and the degrees of that anomalies, so that astronauts could be aware that a big anomaly is detected.
Once we have received our data, we will complete data gaps. Due to the time limit of the experiment, we will perform a “head map” of the magnetic field strength with data obtained by other missions and with all the fresh data.
